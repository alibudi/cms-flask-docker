        **field** - extract fields from a file
        
        SYNOPSIS
        --------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            field [-h] [-f FILE] [-d DELIMITER] [FIELD ...]
        
        DESCRIPTION
        -----------
        
        **field** extracts a list of fields from a file. It is a simpler
        version of::
        
            awk '{ print $5,$3,$1; }'
        
        and similar scripts. Whitespace delimited (space and  tab)  fields  are
        read from stdin and written to stdout.
        
        FIELD  is  assumed  to be 1-indexed integer, separated by commas and/or
        spaces, and take the following form:
        
              N      a single field.
        
              N-M    a range of increasing or decreasing fields from N to M.
        
        **-h**, **--help**
              show concise list of options and exit
        
        **--version**
              display version information and exit
        
        **-f**, **--file** *FILE*
              an explicit file to extract fields
        
        **-d**, **--delimiter** *DELIMITER*
              character delimiter between fields
        
        NOTES
        -----
        
        Field was written to address two short comings of cut:
        
        1. Default Behavior
        
           The default delimiter of cut is tab. Most command line utilities
           produce  output  delimited by whitespace, which includes spaces.
           Field takes this into account and defaults the delimiter to both
           tab and space characters.
        
        2. Field Ordering
        
           Fields  extracted  by  cut  are not listed in the order they are
           passed.
        
        EXAMPLES
        --------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ mount | field 5 3 1
            ext4 / /dev/mapper/sda7_crypt
            proc /proc proc
            sysfs /sys sysfs
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/ | field 1 9
            -rwxr-xr-x airbrake*
            -rwxr-xr-x bayes.rb*
            -rwxr-xr-x bourbon*
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ cat /etc/mtab | cut -d' ' -f 4 | field -d',' 1 4 3 2
            rw gid=5 nosuid noexec
            rw size=10% nosuid noexec
            rw nodev nosuid noexec
            rw user=root nodev nosuid
